Some of the key climate change indicators that scientists have been observing and recording include increasing global land and sea temperatures, melting of ice at the poles, rising sea levels, changes in the frequency and severity of hurricanes, heatwaves, wildfires, droughts, floods and precipitation.

										Over the years, we have been releasing more and more GHGs (greenhouse gasses) into the atmosphere which is causing the Earth’s temperature to rise at an alarming rate. This is causing climate change to take place at an accelerating pace.

										While we cannot stop climate change completely , we can slow it down significantly which will stop some of its worst effects. 
										</p>
										<p class="bottommargin-xs">
										To tackle the devastating effects of climate change, world leaders met at COP 21 in Paris, on 12 December 2015 and entered into the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate change agreement, the Paris Agreement. The agreement entered into force on 4 November 2016 and as of Jan 2021, 190 members of the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate change) are parties to the agreement. The key goal of the agreement is to limit global warming to well below 2° C, preferably to 1.5° C, compared to pre-industrial levels.

										<p class="bottommargin-xs">This agreement works on a 5-year cycle where countries submit their plans for climate action known as nationally determined contributions(NDCs). These NDCs countries will communicate the actions they will take to reduce their Greenhouse Gas(GHG) emissions in order to reach the goals of the Paris Agreement. 
										</p>
										<p class="bottommargin-xs">The agreement also provides a framework for financial, technical and capacity building to support developing/more vulnerable countries and to those who need it. 
										</p>
										<p class="bottommargin-xs">Additionally, progress is tracked by establishing enhanced transparency framework (ETF) and starting 2024, countries will have to report on the actions taken and update their progress which provides international procedures for review of the reports.

									<div class="col-md-6">
										<p class="bottommargin-xs">
										On a broad level, Carbon Neutral simply means to remove the same amount of carbon dioxide that is being emitted into the atmosphere to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. This is usually done by: 
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Reducing carbon emissions by switching to renewable energy sources and changing industry processes.</li>
											<li>Offsetting residual Carbon dioxide emission by purchasing carbon offsets (called carbon offsetting) or credits to make up the difference.</li>

										Radar Tyres has always been committed to the environment. It started its Carbon Neutral journey back in 2012 when EY (Ernst & Young) quantified the amount of greenhouse gases (primarily carbon dioxide) produced, from procuring raw materials to manufacturing, distribution and energy used in the company’s offices and employees' travel. It then started making changes to its process as well as offsetting its residual emissions through investing in wind energy projects. It was in 2013 that Radar Tyres was declared as the world’s first tyre brand to be been Carbon Neutral and it has maintained this certification to date.

										Carbon neutrality (carbon neutral) is achieved by first calculating a company’s carbon footprint and then reducing it to zero through a combination of in-house measures such as reducing its emissions and external measures such as carbon offsetting or investing in carbon reduction projects.

											<li><strong>CALCULATE YOUR CARBON FOOTPRINT:</strong><br> The first step is to quantify the amount of Carbon Dioxide you are emitting into the Earth’s atmosphere through the sum total of your procurement, production and distribution activities.</li>
											<li><strong>REDUCE YOUR CARBON EMISSIONS: </strong><br> This can be done by improving a companies’ process, something as simple as switching to more energy-efficient lighting or optimizing the overall heating and cooling systems can bring efficiency, reducing the overall Carbon Emissions.</li>
											<li><strong>SWITCH TO RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES: </strong><br> Renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, hydro, etc. are cleaner and emit much less Carbon Dioxide as compared to the electricity that is produced through the burning of fossil fuels. Switching to these significantly reduces one's carbon footprint.</li>
											<li><strong>OFFSET YOUR RESIDUAL CARBON EMISSIONS: </strong><br> After doing the above, what gets left behind is called residual emissions. These residual emissions can be tackled through a carbon offset which is a way to compensate for your emissions by funding an equivalent carbon dioxide saving elsewhere. Carbon offsetting balances out emissions by helping to pay for emission savings in other parts of the world.</li>

										Our commitment to climate change dates back to 2012 when we first engaged EY(Ernst & Young) to conduct a twelve-month assessment on Radar Tyres’ total greenhouse gas emissions between April 2011 and March 2012. EY’s study involved a rigorous and independent assessment that examined and quantified the amount of greenhouse gases (primarily carbon dioxide) produced from procuring raw materials to manufacturing, distribution, and energy used in the company’s offices and employees' travel. Based on the study recommendations, we undertook a number of changes to our business processes and actions geared to offset the carbon footprint, such as investing in projects that removed or reduced carbon dioxide from the environment. As a result, Radar Tyres became the first tyre brand to be 100% carbon neutral by late 2013 and we have maintained this certification to date. 
										</p>
										<p class="bottommargin-xs">
										Our work continues in this direction and we are currently defining new sustainability goals in line with the UNGC’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for beyond 2021. The goals will be inclusive of the entire value chain right from raw material technology and procurement to the end of tyre life. We aim to make a positive impact across each of these stages in our value chain.
