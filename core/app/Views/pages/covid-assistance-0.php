									<h2>COVID-19 ASSISTANCE – “WE CARE PROGRAMME”</h2>
								</div>
                            	<p class="topmargin-lg">Dear Patrons,</p>
                            
                            	<p>We are experiencing one of the most challenging times for humanity. The world is gripped by the terrible COVID-19 virus, which has literally brought life on its knees and almost to a stop.</p>

                            	<p>A positive thing about this is that we all realize that a virus has no nationality, no race, and no language. It can affect anyone and everyone in the same way and does not discriminate. At this time, it is important that we all  that we are one human race, one world. It’s time we stop discriminating and fight this menace together as a united human race.</p>

                            	<p>I live in Singapore, which is a country of 6 million people. Currently, our situation is manageable as we are a relatively small nation. But we have our business associates in over 90 countries and our success is because of the people of these 90 countries. We have always believed in giving back to society in whichever way we could, whether small or big. We have always contributed and helped whenever a natural calamity or a disaster has hit any country where we have any association. This has been our way of showing gratitude and gratefulness and reassuring that we stand together. </p>

                            	<p>Sitting here in Singapore, we are concerned about our fellow citizens of this world and their well-being. We have been hearing in the news that protective surgical masks are not available in hospitals of some countries. We are sure the local governments will do all they can to get this sorted but we also feel responsible, as such, we are sending thousands of masks to our patrons and business partners to use and also distribute within their local communities. </p>

                            	<p>We have also seen that governments are stepping up and coming up with various incentives and support plans. Unfortunately, confusion remains, as average small business owners either don’t know or understand where to access such programs and incentives. We are putting together a document, for every country that we do business with, which will give the basic guidelines on what can the small business owner look for and how do they need to go about it. We are just collecting this information and putting this together in one place. We urge you all to read, print, and disseminate it to your customers, so together we all understand and avail what our governments have put out for us.</p>

                            	<p>Please click on the link below and read the information we have put together. This will be updated on a regular basis and more countries will be added to it.</p>
                            	
                            	<p>I am confident that together, as one human race, we will win. </p>
                            	<p>In the meanwhile, please take care yourselves and stay safe.</p>
                            	<p>Your fellow citizen of the world.</p>
