                        <p  class="bottommargin">Meet Olli Seppälä, the head of global R&D at Radar Tires and a trailblazer in the tire industry. With over 20 years of experience in tire development, Olli’s expertise spans from heavy-duty products to passenger car tires, with a focus on delivering exceptional performance and keeping tires affordable for all.</p>

                                    <p class="bottommargin-xs">Olli’s journey in tire innovation began at Nokian Tires, where he spent nearly two decades honing his skills in product development and leading R&D teams. In 2022, he joined Radar Tires, bringing a wealth of experience and a passion for pushing boundaries. “The tire industry has evolved tremendously in the past 20 years,” Olli explains. “Performance demands, sustainability requirements, and legislative standards have all become more stringent, making innovation more critical than ever.”</p>

                        <h4 class="topmargin bottommargin-xxs uppercase">THE COMPLEXITY OF MODERN TIRES</h4>
                        <p class="bottommargin-xxs">A modern tire is far more than just a rubber ring. “Each tire comprises about 20 components,” Olli notes. “Every element impacts the others, requiring meticulous balancing to achieve optimal performance.” One key area is tread compounds, where advancements in silica technology have significantly enhanced wet grip and rolling resistance, albeit with new challenges to overcome. </p>
                        
                        <h4 class="topmargin bottommargin-xxs uppercase">THE MAGIC TRIANGLE OF TiRE DEVELOPMENT</h4>
                        <p class="bottommargin-xxs">Tire development is a fine art, requiring a careful balance of wet grip, rolling resistance, and mileage — often referred to as the “Magic Triangle.” As Olli explains, “Improving one aspect often comes at the expense of the others. Our mission is to expand this triangle, achieving outstanding performance across all metrics.” Through their expertise, Olli and his team have excelled in delivering exceptional results in every area.</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="topmargin bottommargin-xxs uppercase">A UNIQUE BUSINESS MODEL</h4>
                        <p class="bottommargin-xxs">Radar Tires operates without its own manufacturing facilities, a strategic choice that Olli sees as a game-changer. “We can select the best production locations for each product, ensuring top performance and cost-effectiveness,” he explains. “This agility allows us to innovate faster and more efficiently than traditional tire makers.” </p>
                        
                        <h4 class="topmargin bottommargin-xxs uppercase">INNOVATION BEYOND THE TIRE: A GLOBAL APPROACH</h4>
                        <p class="bottommargin-xxs">For Olli, innovation isn’t limited to tread patterns or compounds. “It’s about rethinking the entire process, from business models to supply chains,” he explains. This philosophy extends to Radar Tires’ rigorous global testing process. “We conduct tests worldwide, from winter conditions in Finland to dry tracks in Spain and field testing in the U.S. and Asia,” Olli shares. “This ensures our tires meet the specific needs of diverse markets while maintaining top-tier performance.” </p>
                        
                        <h4 class="topmargin bottommargin-xxs uppercase">DEMOCRATIZING PREMIUM PERFORMANCE</h4>
                        <p class="bottommargin-xxs">Olli’s mission is clear: to make premium-level tire performance accessible to all. “Safety is our top priority, and it’s vital that consumers can rely on their tires in critical moments,” he says. “Our goal is to deliver tires that compete with premium brands while remaining affordable, ensuring safety and performance for every driver.” </p>
                        
                        <h4 class="topmargin bottommargin-xxs uppercase">LOOKING TO THE FUTURE</h4>
                        <p class="bottommargin-xxs">As the automotive industry shifts towards electrification, Radar Tires is already adapting. “Electric vehicles bring unique challenges, such as reduced noise and higher torque requirements,” Olli says. “We’re designing tires that not only meet these demands but also enhance the overall driving experience.” </p>
                        
                        <h4 class="topmargin bottommargin-xxs uppercase">A VISION OF EXCELLENCE</h4>
                        <p class="bottommargin-xxs">“We’re here to redefine what’s possible in the tire industry,” Olli concludes. “By combining top-tier performance with affordability, we’re democratizing premium tires and ensuring that safety and quality are within everyone’s reach.”</p>
