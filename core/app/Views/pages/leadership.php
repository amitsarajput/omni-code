                  <p>G.S. Sareen is the founder, President and CEO of Omni United, one of the most dynamic companies in the tyre industry. He founded Omni United in 2003, after having identified the market opportunity available to an agile, efficient, customer-service oriented and design-driven global tyre supplier, with state of-the-art logistics and supply chain management. Under his direction, Omni has rapidly grown and evolved in the area of design, manufacturing and distribution of tyres worldwide, offering a complete range of products and service solutions to its customers in over 80 countries.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Sareen has always believed in Speed, Innovation, Sustainability and Giving back to society as the core of the company’s vision. In 2011 he launched the Mobilising Hope Campaign through which the company supported Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF). In early 2012 he set the strategic goal for Omni United to become the first tyre company in the world to become carbon neutral and this was achieved through the Radar Tyres brand in late 2013. In November 2014 he launched Timberland Tyres through an innovative partnership between Timberland and Omni United that was based on sustainability at its core.</p>
                  <p>Prior to founding Omni United, Mr. Sareen was an early entrepreneur in the booming online e-commerce industry. He successfully launched, managed and subsequently sold mindtrac.com, one of the first B2B online market exchanges in the tyre industry, backed by JP Morgan.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Sareen is an alumnus of the Daly School and the Science College in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India, and is a decorated and distinguished member of the Indian Army where he served for close to seven years. He was awarded a gallantry award for action in 1993 by the President of India. He was born in India and has been a resident in Singapore since 1994.</p>
                  <p>Throughout his professional career, Mr. Sareen has received numerous entrepreneurship and corporate leadership awards and recognitions, the most recent one being felicitated by the government of Madhya Pradesh, India in 2018 for having done pioneering work in his professional field and for his achievements; being included in the prestigious “Singapore Enterprise 50 Awards” for five consecutive years from 2013-2017, for Singapore-based, privately-held companies who have contributed to economic development in Singapore and abroad; in 2014 he was recognised by Peak Magazine as one of Singapore’s top 30 influential business leaders; the same year Prestige Magazine featured him among the 100 headlining movers and shakers in Singapore; in 2013 he was conferred the “Distinguished Business Award” by Promising SME 500 for his commercial success and contributions to the economy and community at large; and many more.</p>
