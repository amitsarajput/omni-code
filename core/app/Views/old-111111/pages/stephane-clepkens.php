                                    <h3 class="bottommargin-xs uppercase">A career forged on the track</h3>
                                    <p class="bottommargin-xs">Stéphane began his journey in 2000 as a test driver for Continental Tires, focusing on Original Equipment (OE) tires for BMW. Over the next three years, he honed his skills in precision testing, learning the nuances of chassis and tire dynamics. In 2003, Stéphane took a bold leap into freelancing, collaborating with leading tire brands such as Dunlop, Yokohama, Hankook, and Bridgestone.</p>

                        <h4 class="topmargin bottommargin-xxs uppercase">Joining Radar Tires: a new chapter</h4>
                        <p class="bottommargin-xxs">Stéphane’s decision to join Radar Tires was driven by the company’s progressive approach. “Radar Tires impressed me with their flat, horizontal management structure and the freedom they offer to innovate,” Stéphane shares. “Their mission to deliver premium-level performance at accessible prices aligns perfectly with my vision of democratizing tire safety and quality.”</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="topmargin bottommargin-xxs uppercase">A unique philosophy on tire testing</h4>
                        <p class="bottommargin-xxs">For Stéphane, real-world testing is at the heart of tire development. “Tires are complex and highly technical products,” he explains. “Their performance can only be truly understood under real driving conditions, where we transform subjective customer feedback into objective targets for research and development.”</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="topmargin bottommargin-xxs uppercase">Redefining premium</h4>
                        <p class="bottommargin-xxs">Stéphane’s mission at Radar Tires is clear: to elevate the brand to premium status while ensuring that its products remain affordable for all. “Every market is different, and in Europe, I know what customers and carmakers expect from their tires,” he says. “Reaching premium standards requires targeting the same benchmarks as the established leaders, but we’re committed to achieving this without compromising on cost-effectiveness.” </p>
                        
                        <h4 class="topmargin bottommargin-xxs uppercase">Making safety accessible</h4>
                        <p class="bottommargin-xxs">Stéphane’s passion extends beyond performance metrics to the broader impact of his work. “Tires are the only points of contact between a car and the road,” he notes. “Democratizing premium tire performance means providing young drivers, retirees, and everyone in between with access to safe, reliable products.”</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="topmargin bottommargin-xxs uppercase">Looking ahead</h4>
                        <p class="bottommargin-xxs">Despite his extensive experience, Stéphane continues to find joy and discovery in his work. “Every day, I learn something new,” he says. “When we develop a truly brilliant product, it’s a rewarding experience that reminds me why I’m passionate about what I do.”</p>
                        
                        <h4 class="topmargin bottommargin-xxs uppercase">Why choose Radar Tires?</h4>
