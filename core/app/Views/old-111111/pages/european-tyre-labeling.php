				<h3 class="bottommargin-xs uppercase">ABOUT THE EUROPEAN TYRE LABELING</h3>

				<p class="bottommargin">The European Tyre labelling came into effect in 2012 and mandated that all tyres sold in Europe must have the mandatory tyre labels. The aim of this was to increase the safety, environmental and economic efficiency of road transport by promoting safe and fuel-efficient tyres with low noise levels. These labels provide the end-user clear and standardized information on three criteria: fuel efficiency, wet grip and external rolling noise of tyres so end-users can make more informed choices when purchasing tyres.</p>

					<div class="col-lg-8">
						<h3  class="bottommargin-xs uppercase">1. Rolling Resistance/Fuel Efficiency</h3>

						<p class="bottommargin">Rolling Resistance directly impacts fuel efficiency which in turn impacts the environment(CO2 emissions). There are 7 classes from A, (most efficient), to G (least efficient). The effect may vary among vehicles and driving conditions, but the difference between an A and a G class for a complete set of tyres could reduce fuel consumption by up to 7.5 %* and even more in case of trucks.</p>

						<h3  class="bottommargin-xs uppercase">2. Wet Grip</h3>

						<p class="bottommargin">Wet grip is a criteria that is critical for your safety as it affects how quickly you will be able to stop in wet conditions. There are 7 classes from A (shortest braking distances) to G (longest  braking distances). The effects may vary among vehicles and driving conditions, but in the case of full braking, the difference between an A and a G class for a set of four identical tyres could be up to 30% shorter braking distance (e.g. for a typical passenger car driving at 80 km/h speed this could be up to 18m shorter braking distance)*.</p>

				<h3 class="bottommargin-xs uppercase">3. External Rolling noise</h3>

				<p class="bottommargin">This is the amount of external noise a tyre makes when it rolls along the road surface. The driving noise is quoted as an absolute value in decibel and in addition to that a pictogram displays whether the tyre external rolling noise performance is above future European mandatory limit value (3 black waves = noisy tyre), meets the future limit value or is up to 3 dB quieter (2 black waves = average tyre), or is over 3 dB quieter than the future limit value (1 black wave = quiet tyre).</p>
